Run `make` and copy the resulting `pop` binary to wherever you want it.

On Linux, Pop requires libbsd. If you have libbsd and Pop still won't compile,
make sure you've also installed libbsd-dev or libbsd-devel (depending on your
distribution).

Running tests is optional but if you want to run them you'll need a reasonably
up-to-date Ruby.
